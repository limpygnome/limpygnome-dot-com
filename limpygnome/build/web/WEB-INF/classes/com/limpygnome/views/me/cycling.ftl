    My current bike.
</div>

<p>
    I currently own a Carrera TDF 2013 road bike, with 700x28c Gatorskin tyres and Velox rim tape.
</p>

<p>
    When I first got the bike, I used to have a puncture every week, which is expensive,
    since I use Schwalbe inner tubes, since they have reliable valves. Thus, I solved this by
    replacing the tyres and rim tape on both wheels.
</p>

<p>
    From my experience, I have found Velox rim tape is far better than the manufacturer's plastic
    tape, which still allowed the holes of the spokes, on the wheel rim, to puncture the inner-tubes.
    With around over a 1,100 miles using the above tyre and rim tape, at the time of writing this
    page, I have yet to have a puncture.

    Me, after my first century.
</div>

<p>
    On 12th of April 2014, I completed my first century (100 miles) for a local charity,
    <a href="http://www.eatingmatters.org.uk/">Eating Matters</a>, with two fellow friends.
    The route departed from Norwich, headed towards Cromer, then to Great Yarmouth, with a short stop
    outside of Lowestoft and back to Norwich.
</p>

<p>
    The ride took around 12 hours and we only initially intended aimed for only 60 miles. At the
    time of writing this page, I don't know how much we raised, but probably not a lot. Regardless,
    a lot of posting on Facebook, e-mail and other places; brought awareness to the charity.
</p>

<h4>70 Mile Sprint</h4>
<p>
    On the 1st of July, I completed 70 miles with a 16mph average.
