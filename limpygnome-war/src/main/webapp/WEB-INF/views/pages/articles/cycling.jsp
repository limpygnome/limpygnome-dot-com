        After being in an accident with my primary bike end of 2014, I decided to buy another for
        general commuting. However this has now turned into my primary backup bike.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar to my primary bike, it has 700x23c Gatorskin tyres and Velox rim tape. The frame is 54cm, uses a Crivit
        Bike Computer and weighs roughly the same.

        My old primary training and leisure road bike, now used as a backup and for a trainer,
         is a Carrera TDF 2013 with 700x23c Gatorskin tyres and Velox rim tape.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I first got the bike, I used to have a puncture every week, which is expensive,
        since I use Schwalbe inner tubes, since they have reliable valves. Thus, I solved this by
        replacing the tyres and rim tape on both wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
        From my experience, I have found Velox rim tape is far better than the manufacturer's plastic
        tape, which still allowed the holes of the spokes, on the wheel rim, to puncture the inner-tubes.
        With around over 1,800 miles using the above tyre and rim tape, at the time of writing this
        page, I have yet to have a puncture.

        Me, after my first century.
    </div>

    <p>
        On 12th of April 2014, I completed my first century (100 miles) for a local charity,
        <a href="http://www.eatingmatters.org.uk/">Eating Matters</a>, with two fellow friends.
        The route departed from Norwich, headed towards Cromer, then to Great Yarmouth, with a short stop
        outside of Lowestoft and back to Norwich.
    </p>

    <p>
        The ride took around 12 hours and we only initially intended aimed for only 60 miles. At the
        time of writing this page, I don't know how much we raised, but probably not a lot. Regardless,
        a lot of posting on Facebook, e-mail and other places; brought awareness to the charity.
    </p>

    <h3>70 Mile Sprint</h3>
    <p>
        On the 1st of July, I completed 70 miles with a 16mph average.
